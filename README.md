# Stan Coding Challenge
Navigate to https://react-coding-challenge-rho.vercel.app/ to view.

To test locally,
- clone/fork the repository `https://github.com/Oluwafayokemi/react-coding-challenge.git`
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm start` to start development build
    - Navigate to `localhost:8080` on your browser to see the build
- run `npm build` to build for production

## Tools/Technology used:
- React: Useful to create reusable UI components.
- Context APi: To essentially create global variables that can be passed around in a React app, but not suitable for a large application, Redux should be implemented
- Styled Component(still write actual css, difference is inside js file): To allow CSS in JS, I figure, I can be faster if I don't move between css file and js, just write everything in my js file

#### If there was more time, 
- For Context Api, I will persist my state saving to localstorage or session storage. I could also make use of Redux to manage my state(best approach)
- implement the blue popup on the header.
